## T1A3 - Terminal Project
# Dynamic Queue System


## How to use
### Modes
 - `ruby triage.rb --local` This will run the DynaQueue system locally in one terminal. You can run many instances of this but they will not be able to interact with one another
 - `ruby triage.rb --server` This will run the DynaQueue server in the terminal. Only run one instance of this.
 - `ruby triage.rb --client` This will run the DynaQueue client in the terminal. You can run many instances of this.
Using `--admin` in addition will allow you to run database management before running the software in your chosen mode
Using `--testing` will remove all prompts when creating queue items and will populate some data for the items randomly
